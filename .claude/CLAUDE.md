# Fork-Specific Agent Instructions

> **This is `clawdbot-dev`** (private fork). PRs go to the public fork, then upstream.

## Start Here

**Read `.workflow/AGENTS.md`** for complete workflow documentation including:
- Three-remote git model (dev → fork → upstream)
- Upstream contribution workflows
- One-shot prompt templates for issues/PRs
- Slash commands reference
- Quality standards and multi-agent safety

## Quick Reference

```bash
/dev:help              # List all commands
/dev:gate              # Quality gate - run before every commit
/dev:tdd red|green|refactor [feature]  # TDD workflow
```
